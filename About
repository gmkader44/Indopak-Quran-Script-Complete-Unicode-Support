Quran Indopak Script (Unicode Enhanced)
I have created an Indopak Quran script that uses the latest Unicode standards for both font and text. This solves many problems found in older Indopak texts, such as broken copy-paste, wrong text direction, and font incompatibility.

Key Features
✅ All Arabic waqf marks are correctly included as Unicode, so they display properly everywhere.

✅ The Arabic text always keeps the right-to-left (RTL) direction by adding RLM (Right-to-Left Mark) characters before and after.

✅ The text stays unbroken when copied and pasted into any application.

✅ Works with any modern Arabic font that supports the latest Unicode.

✅ Displays correctly in Google Docs and similar tools.

NB: The Indopak script is also known as South Asian Arabic Script, Nastaliq Script, Nastaleeq Script, or South Asian Quranic Text.
