Indopak Quran Script
This project offers a fully Unicode-compliant Indopak Quran script that accurately displays Arabic Quranic text. It utilizes the latest Unicode standards for both the font and the text. This approach resolves several issues found in older Indopak texts, including problems with copy-pasting, incorrect text direction, and font incompatibility.

Key Features
✅ All Arabic waqf marks are correctly included as Unicode, so they display properly everywhere.

✅ The Arabic text always keeps the right-to-left (RTL) direction by adding RLM (Right-to-Left Mark) characters before and after.

✅ The text stays unbroken when copied and pasted into any application.

✅ Works with any modern Arabic font that supports the latest Unicode.

✅ Displays correctly in Google Docs and similar tools.

NB: The Indopak script is also known as South Asian Arabic Script, Nastaliq Script, Nastaleeq Script, or South Asian Quranic Text.

To see how it looks, I have developed a Quran website for testing and viewing purposes only: https://quranwebapp.netlify.app
